# OpenModelica-HVDC-NTNU

This file contains OpenModelica models of components in an HVDC grid developed at NTNU. The components were originally MMCs, HVDC cables, transformers, energy storage, wind turbine, and also three HVDC models. 


For more information on the models used, refer to the Masters Thesis's "Modeling of Multiterminal HVDC grids with Renewable Energy and Storage Integration by Opensource Tools" by Joachim Espvik at NTNU, 2019, or "Modeling of the MMC and its energy dynamics in an offshore HVDC perspective using OpenModelica" by Erling Vatn Tranulis at NTNU, 2019. Alternatively, look up the paper "Modeling of Multiterminal HVDC Offshore Grids with Renewable Energy and Storage Integration by Opensource Tools" by J. Espvik et al. at IEEExplore.
